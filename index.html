                The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building on the Maidan in Central Kolkata, having its entrance on the Queen's Way. It was built between 1906 and 1921 by the Government of India. It is dedicated to the memory of Victoria, Empress of India from 1876 to 1901. It is the largest monument to a monarch anywhere in the world, it stands in 64 acres of gardens and is now a museum under the control of the Ministry of Culture.Possessing prominent features of the Anglo-Indian architecture of the imperial era, it has evolved into one of the most popular places in the city.</p><br>
                <p>The architect of the Victoria Memorial was William Emerson (1843–1924).The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style which uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani architectural influences.The building is 338 by 228 feet (103 by 69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet (56 m). It is constructed of white Makrana marble.The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson's assistant, Vincent Jerome Esch, designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates. In 1902, Emerson engaged Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial.

                 On top of the central dome of the Memorial is the 16 ft (4.9 m) figure of the Angel of Victory. Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures including Art, Architecture, Justice, and Charity and above the North Porch are Motherhood, Prudence and Learning.

                 The Victoria Memorial is built of white Makrana marble.In design it echoes the Taj Mahal with its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal-domed chattris, high portals, terrace, and domed corner towers.</p>

                    The Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in 1943,the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the same location linking the cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965, it was renamed Rabindra Setu after the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and Asian Nobel laureate.It is still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.</p><br>

                <p>The bridge is one of four on the Hooghly River and is a famous symbol of Kolkata and West Bengal. The other bridges are the Vidyasagar Setu (popularly called the Second Hooghly Bridge), the Vivekananda Setu and the relatively new Nivedita Setu. It carries a daily traffic of approximately 100,000 vehiclesand possibly more than 150,000 pedestrians,easily making it the busiest cantilever bridge in the world.The third-longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction,the Howrah Bridge is currently the sixth-longest bridge of its type in the world.<br>
                    The Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) is vested with the maintenance of the bridge. The bridge has been subject to damage from vehicles due to rash driving, and corrosion due to atmospheric conditions and biological wastes. In October 2008, 6 high-tech surveillance cameras were placed to monitor the entire 705 metres (2,313 ft) long and 30 metres (98 ft) wide structure from the control room. Two of the cameras were placed under the floor of the bridge to track the movement of barges, steamers and boats on the river, while the other four were fixed to the first layer of beams — one at each end and two in the middle — to monitor vehicle movements. This was in response to substantial damage caused to the bridge from collisions with vehicles, so that compensation could be claimed from the miscreants.</p>

There are twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva, Kali's consort, along the riverfront, a temple to Radha–Krishna, a bathing ghat on the river, a shrine dedicated to Rani Rashmoni. 'Nahabat', the chamber in the northwestern corner just beyond the last of the Shiva temples, is where Ramakrishna and Maa Sarada spent a considerable part of their lives.

                    Park Street, is a famous thoroughfare in downtown Kolkata, India. In Bengali, it is often referred as Shaheb-er Para or the “neighbourhood of Englishmen”.The street runs through what was a deer park of Sir Elijah Impey, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Calcutta from 1773 to 1789, hence the earlier name. It's located in central part of Calcutta.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Documented records of the throughfare can be traced back to 1760, when Kolkata (then Calcutta) was the capital of the British Empire in India. Since 1760, the street has been through several name changes. Previous names include 'Ghorustan ka Rasta', Vansittart Avenue and Burial Ground Road.</p><br>

<p>Some 250 years ago, Park Street was known as Burial Ground Road and was not a preferred choice of residence, as there were a number of cemeteries in this area, the South Park Street Cemetery, opposite to it was the North Park Street Cemetery (now replaced by a school). Further west, there were two smaller cemeteries, one French and one Italian (now replaced by offices and schools).</p><br>

<p>Park Street has been the main evening recreation zone for Kolkata people since the British era. In the 1970s and 1980s much of Kolkata's night life took place in Park Street, with many clubs and restaurants situated there. Many noted musicians had played at various popular night spots, such as Trinca's, Peter Cat, Oly Pub, Blue Fox, Mocambo and Moulin Rouge. Even before that, from the 1940s through to the late 1960s, Kolkata's prolific night life was centred on fashionable Park Street. The Park Hotel chain started with the opening of its first hotel, the 150 room The Park Hotel on 1 November 1967.The park street name coinage is assumed to be having association with such a history.</p><br>

                <img src="./images/PRINCEP GHAT.jpg" height="300" alt="image of princep ghat">
                <p>Prinsep Ghat is a ghat built in 1841 during the British Raj, along the Kolkata bank of the Hooghly River in India. The Palladian porch in the memory of the eminent Anglo-Indian scholar and antiquary James Prinsep was designed by W. Fitzgerald and constructed in 1843.</P><br>

                    <p>Located between the Water Gate and the St George's Gate of the Fort William, the monument to Prinsep is rich in Greek and Gothic inlays. It was restored by the state's public works department in November 2001 and has since been well-maintained.In its initial years, all royal British entourages used the Prinsep Ghat jetty for embarkation and disembarkation.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>Prinsep Ghat is one of the oldest recreational spots of Kolkata.People visit it in the evenings on weekends to go boating on the river, stroll along the bank and purchase food from stalls there. A 2-kilometre (1.2 mi) stretch of the beautified riverfront from Prinsep Ghat to Babughat (Baje Kadamtala Ghat) was inaugurated on 24 May 2012.It has illuminated and landscaped gardens and pathways, fountains and renovated ghats. One of the songs in the Bollywood film Parineeta was shot here on the ghats.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>Prinsep Ghat also has a railway station named after it. The station is part of the Kolkata Circular Railway which is maintained by Eastern Railway. The station code is PPGT.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>There is a jetty nearby called the Man-O-War jetty that belongs to the Kolkata Port Trust and commemorates the role played by the port in the Second World War. The jetty is mainly used by the Indian Navy.</p><br>

                <img src="./images/METCALFE HALL.jpg" height="300" alt="image of metcalfe hall">
                <p>Metcalfe Hall is a heritage building situated in Kolkata, India, at the junction of Strand Road and Hare Street in the heart of the city's business district. The architecture is reflective of the British imperial architecture at the middle of the nineteenth century, and visually similar to ancient Greek temples. It was built between 1840 and 1844 according to the design prepared by the city magistrate, C.K. Robinson and named after Sir Charles T. Metcalfe, the Governor-General of India, in honour of his efforts towards a free press. The building faces the Hooghly river on the West.</p><br>

                   <p>Initially, the building housed the Calcutta Public Library collection, formed by Lord Metcalf, then the Governor General, who transferred 4,675 volumes from the library of the College of Fort William. These volumes and donations of books from individuals formed the nucleus of the library, which was created under private auspices. Dwarkanath Tagore was the first proprietor of Calcutta Public Library.[1] Presently, the ground floor houses the Asiatic Society's rare foreign journals and manuscripts section,[2] while the first floor houses offices, exhibition galleries and a sales counter of the Archaeological Survey of India.</p><br>

                      <p>The main entrance from the West comprising a giant flight of stairs has been closed. The building is now accessed through the portico on the East, from the portico on the 'Hare Street'. The building is raised on a solid basement and thirty huge Corinthian pillars support a massive entablature. The columns and colonnade surround the whole building.</p><br>
